# Dependencies And Sources

This document exists so the orchestrator can work from a fresh GPU template without access to the original development machine.

Everything needed to understand the run is either:

- included in this repository, or
- listed here as an external dependency with its purpose

## Included In This Repository

These are self-contained in the handoff repo:

- experiment framing
- prior experiment findings
- strategy rationale
- setup instructions
- measurement and gate rules
- run-repo templates
- bootstrap and validation scripts

## External Dependencies

These are not bundled because they are large, authoritative, or need to stay source-of-truth from upstream.

### 1. Base model

- `tomg-group-umd/huginn-0125`

Purpose:

- recurrent-depth base model for the first-wave probe strategies

### 2. Training data

Use one or more of:

- local structured trace corpora
- public multi-hop reasoning datasets
- public causal reasoning datasets
- domain-specific corpora materialized through `data_recipes.yaml`

Purpose:

- structured supervision for recurrent-depth training or probing
- source for SFT, DPO-style, contrastive, correction, or probe-focused variants

### 3. Task-specific benchmark suites

Use a benchmark only when its prompt and output contract are stable enough to interpret.

Purpose:

- secondary behavior checks once formatting and parsing are validated

### 4. Standard benchmark sources

Use a standard internal or public access path for:

- HotpotQA
- MuSiQue
- DROP
- CausalQA or COPA if available
- StrategyQA-style causal plausibility checks if available

Purpose:

- primary first-wave external behavior checks for multi-hop and causal transfer

## Fresh-System Rule

If the orchestrator is missing information and cannot access the original development machine, it should rely on:

1. the distilled documents in this handoff repo
2. the external sources listed here

It should **not** assume any hidden local files exist elsewhere.
