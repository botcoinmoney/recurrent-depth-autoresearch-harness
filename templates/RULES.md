# Live Run Rules

This repository contains live run state.

## Never Do These

- never merge LoRA adapters into the base model
- never overwrite the base model path
- never treat missing artifacts as implied success
- never keep training through collapse
- never hide failures from `findings.md`

## Required Practice

- update `findings.md` on every material event
- push often
- keep logs and artifacts named by phase and timestamp
- stop and investigate the actual failure when something breaks
- follow the bundled `handoff/docs/CANONICAL_TESTING_METHODS.md` and `handoff/docs/GPU_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md` rather than improvising method details
